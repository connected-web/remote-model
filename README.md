## HTTPS Agent

In order to access content securely over HTTPS, the `https` lib is used to create a https agent for network requests. It is recommended that you set up the following environment variables prior to running your script. By default, the script expects the `CLIENT_CERT`, `CLIENT_KEY`, and `CLIENT_CA` to exist, for example:

```sh
export CLIENT_CERT="/user/certs/path.crt"
export CLIENT_KEY="/user/certs/path.key"
export CLIENT_CA="/user/certs/ca_bundle.crt"
```
